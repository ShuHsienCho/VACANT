\title{Extract Per-Sample Alleles from Genotype Strings}
\usage{
extract_sub(x, idx)
}

\item{x}{Character vector of genotype strings.}

\item{idx}{Integer vector. Sample positions to extract.}
}
\value{
Character scalar of extracted alleles (one character per sample).

\description{
Given a vector of XPAT-format genotype strings (one per variant) and a
vector of sample positions, extracts a single concatenated string of
allele counts for those samples.
